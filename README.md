Most Todo list projects are boring and deemed unnecessary, but that's only because developers focus on CRUD operations, neglecting all UI/UX aspects of the project. Clich√© Todo list projects can be made effective if developers actually use it and make it tailored fit for their needs. That's what I did with Trouve!

Trouve is French for 'to find'. The correct pronunciation to the best of my knowledge is through-way. It's a personal productivity tool where you can find all the missing pieces of your life. Got a new place to eat? Hold on to that thought, you might forget it! With trouve, you can add these forgettable things that come to your mind and later reference it so you don't miss out on what you planned for!

Trouve let's you add items, categorize them, delete items, save items, search them by their title, add deadlines to your todos and sort them by deadline etc.

As of now it's tailored fit for my needs and I have been using Trouve since May 15th 2021, regularly! Oh also, did I mention it has a dark mode too?

This is something I cannot not brag about - Trouve is a Progressive Web App! Spoiler Alert - Some common PWA features are still missing from it, but I'm constantly working on it to make it more amazing than ever! PWA is a web application that works and looks a lot like mobile applications. In layman's terms, when you first open Trouve on your phone, you'll get an option to 'Add it to your Home Screen' . Once you do that, Trouve will appear like a native mobile application on your phone whilst still being a web app.
